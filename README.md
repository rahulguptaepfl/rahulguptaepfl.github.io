## Projects
###  Countrywide/Large-scale Assessment of Renewable Energy Resources Hosting Capacity and Flexibility Requirements of the Power Distribution Grids in the USA using Synthetic Models [link](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/217874)

The aim of the project is to build realistic synthetic models of electricity distribution networks that can be characterised as a function of geo-specific factors such as the density of electricity demand, weather conditions, types of region (urban or rural), topography, etc. We will then use these synthetic networks to calculate their capacity to accommodate renewable energies, using a tool developed as part of this project. In addition, we will also develop an optimal planning tool to optimise the amount of energy storage and network reinforcement required to increase the capacity of existing networks. These analyses will enable engineers to design future electricity networks and policy makers to make informed decisions on different energy system policies for different regions of the country.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
