<p>The aim of the project is to build realistic synthetic models of electricity distribution networks that can be characterized as a function of geo-specific factors such as the density of electricity demand, weather conditions, types of regions (urban or rural), topography, etc. We will then use these synthetic networks to calculate their capacity to accommodate renewable energies, using a tool developed as part of this project. In addition, we will also develop an optimal planning tool to optimize the amount of energy storage and network reinforcement required to increase the capacity of existing networks. These analyses will enable engineers to design future electricity networks and policymakers to make informed decisions on different energy system policies for different regions of the country.</p>
